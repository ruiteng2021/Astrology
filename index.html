                <h1>Rat</h1>
                <p>In China, the rat is a veneered symbol of good luck and wealth, 
                    unlike her western gutter-dwelling counterpart. </br>
                    But in both east and west, Rats are most often behind the scenes, 
                    curiously observing and then taking opportunities that come their way.  </br> </br>
                    Characteristically, Rats are ingenious at overcoming adversity and you 
                    are skilled at using your charm and persuasive  </br>
                    powers to ensure your own goals are met without ever seeming manipulative. </br>
                    Rats love socialising, and you are at your happiest surrounded by your close-knit clan. 
                    To those in your pack you are generous and fiercely loyal, but you are often defensive 
                    and uptight with outsiders.  </br> </br>
                    Professionally, you detest bureaucracy and tight deadlines reduce you to despair. 
                    Luckily, you can usually charm your way around such limitations and your 
                    lucky streak generally ensures good fortune finds you. </br> </br>
                    In love, Rats are adventurous pleasure-seekers and monotony is your worst fear. 
                    The most compatible match for a Rat is the Dragon or the Monkey.

                <h1>Ox</h1>
                <p>
                    The Chinese Ox is sturdy and steadfast, a born leader and a great 
                    practical thinker. You are ruled by your head and achieve through hard graft. </br>
                    Unlike the western image of a bull in a china shop, the Chinese Ox is more 
                    refined, and you have a fine eye for the smaller details. </br></br>
                    Oxen are honorable creatures and, although you can be dogmatic and 
                    traditional in your approach to situations, you have a strong moral code. 
                    You do not respond well to change and can tend to be obstructive if 
                    others force situations upon you. </br></br>
                    You are loyal and protective of those dearest to you and would rather 
                    work out problems in private, even if that takes time, than move on to new pastures.</br></br>
                    The most compatible match for an Ox is the Snake or the Rooster.

                <h1>Tiger</h1>
                <p>
                    The Chinese Tiger is a magnetic creature and few animals can resist your raw, 
                    seductive appeal when you’re on the prowl.</br>
                    Although the Tiger is not the King of the Jungle, you are most certainly 
                    Queen of all you survey and your authoritative manner generally ensures 
                    that you stay in control. You don’t deal with failure well, though, and 
                    demonstrate a fiery temper if challenged. </br></br>
                    Tigers are smart and inventive in business, and you’re very good at 
                    taking the initiative and winning. </br></br>
                    While you are a powerful force to be reckoned with sexually, 
                    snaring your prey with your seductive charms, you hate being 
                    caged yourself and retreat if you sense an emotional trap. </br></br>
                    The most compatible match for a Tiger is a Horse or a Dog.

                <h1>Rabbit</h1>
                <p>
                    The Chinese Rabbit is popular for its warm nature and sensitivity. 
                    Vulnerable creatures, Bunny Girls need love and protection to thrive. </br></br>
                    As a Rabbit, you feel most comfortable in the hub of a large group 
                    of close friends or family. You don’t deal well with isolation or 
                    loneliness and depend on others for emotional support and validation.</br></br>
                    Bunnies are incapable of fighting alone, so tend to bolt if faced 
                    with problems or arguments. Sometimes, even minor decision-making 
                    can be traumatic for poor Rabbits. </br></br>
                    Rabbits have keen senses of smell but this goes beyond the physical 
                    – you are extremely sensitive to people and situations and your 
                    intuition is seldom wrong. Many Rabbits are also psychically gifted.</br></br>
                    The Rabbit is most compatible with the Goat or the Pig.

                <p>
                    The Chinese Dragon is one of the most powerful of all the animals, 
                    using its fiery energy to achieve greatness. </br></br>
                    You dragons are charismatic creatures and breathe warmth and 
                    energy into all that you do. This makes you infectiously charming 
                    and generally popular. You love to be in charge and spark enthusiasm 
                    in others for whatever project you’re working on. </br></br>
                    You can be self-important, however, and your impatient streak can mean
                     you live up to your name. </br></br>
                     With all that fire, dragons are passionate and sexy and blessed with 
                     a great deal of luck in love. You’re hot on emotions and get frustrated 
                     by those who take a cooler approach than you. </br></br>
                     Dragons are champions of the weak and, even though you can be 
                     insensitive to those who don’t do things your way, you’re quick to rise 
                     to the defence of more timid animals. </br></br>
                     The most compatible match for a Dragon is the Snake or the Rat.

                <p>
                    The Chinese Snake is the most seductive animal of the zodiac, 
                    oozing sensual power with an air of mystery. </br></br>
                    Snakes tend to be extravagant creatures and love beautiful 
                    clothes and possessions. Luckily, you have a stout financial mind 
                    so you are gifted at making your money go a long way. </br></br>
                    Although the Chinese Snake is not as sly as the western stereotype, 
                    you do enjoy being party to a good bit of gossip and you are very 
                    skilful at eliciting people’s secret confidences. </br></br>
                    Snakes have a deep-rooted scepticism and jealousy and distrust 
                    can mar your relationships if you don’t loosen the reins of control 
                    occasionally. </br></br>
                    The most compatible match for a Snake is the stylish Rooster or the stalwart Ox.

                <p>
                    The Chinese Horse is a true thoroughbred – naturally elegant 
                    and graceful, but with an untameable wild and tempestuous streak. </br></br>
                    Horses prize their independence and have an unquenchable passion 
                    for travel. You therefore tend towards a minimalistic way of life 
                    with few material possessions as you prefer to be free to follow your 
                    flights of fancy. </br></br>
                    Horses are pioneering spirits and are often the first to discover 
                    new territory. You thrive in less disciplined environments where 
                    you are free to explore your own methods of doing things. </br></br>
                    Your wild temperament means you hunger for physical intimacy and 
                    closeness, yet you are afraid of being emotionally fettered. 
                    You love the buzz of new faces, places and hot gossip. </br></br>
                    The most compatible match for the Horse is the Dog or the Tiger.

                <p>
                    The Chinese Goat is an independent, introspective creature, 
                    preferring the interior world of its own imagination to the drudgery 
                    of the materialistic world. </br></br>
                    Goats are hugely creative, great lovers of tranquillity and beautiful 
                    places. In fact, you love nothing better than time to yourself to 
                    indulge your daydreaming. Any kind of monotonous reality gets you 
                    down and you are at your best when allowed to experiment with your t
                    ypically non-linear approach. </br></br>
                    Although you are largely unmaterialistic and you shun power or 
                    responsibility, you enjoy luxury and like to have the means to 
                    be generous to those you love. </br></br>
                    You detest emotional scenes and public shows of affection and keep 
                    your personal life and your feelings close to your chest. 
                    But your imaginative streak extends to the bedroom and you’re 
                    certainly not as sheepish as you initially appear. </br></br>
                    Goats are most compatible with Pigs or Rabbits.

                <h1>Monkey</h1>
                <p>
                    True to your name, the Chinese Monkey is a cheeky creature, 
                    the joker in the pack. Popular and sociable, you’re where the party’s at. </br></br>
                    Your great energy allows you to swing from group to group and you 
                    like to keep up with a wide selection of friends rather than a 
                    close group of intimates, not least because of your love of gossip! 
                    You’re great at lightening the mood and you laugh in the face of adversity, 
                    but sometimes you don’t know when the joke’s over and it’s time to be serious. </br></br>
                    The Monkey is an ingenious animal and you’re quick to master complicated 
                    theories and use your lateral thinking to get around obstacles. </br></br>
                    In love, the Monkey hates commitment and you rebel against anything 
                    or anyone who tries to compromise your independence. If you feel 
                    trapped emotionally, you are likely to be unfaithful. </br></br>
                    Monkeys are most compatible with Rats or Dragons.

                <h1>Rooster</h1>
                <p>
                    The most stylish animal in the Chinese Zodiac, Roosters are very 
                    visual. The Rooster delights in material goods and aesthetic perfection. </br></br>
                    As a Rooster, you’re a calm customer and you don’t like to ruffle your 
                    feathers unnecessarily. You spend too much time preening to lose your 
                    composure in public. That said, you can be theatrical and over-dramatic
                    if the perfect world you strive for is threatened. </br></br>
                    Combined with your keen eye for detail, your love of 
                    wealth and material possessions means you are likely to spend 
                    a great deal of time and investment on perfecting your dream home. </br></br>
                    Naturally, you like to rule the roost and, despite your love of 
                    physical beauty, will prefer a more subdued mate who will be content 
                    to bask in your limelight. </br></br>
                    The most compatible match for a Rooster is the Snake or the Ox
                </p>

                <h1>Dog</h1>
                <p>
                    The Chinese Dog is as loyal as his western counterpart 
                    but can have a sharp bite and a determined bark. </br></br>
                    Dogs love to please those they love, even if this involves 
                    bending the truth ever so slightly to keep the peace. 
                    And if your cover is blown, you Dogs hang on to your 
                    new version of events like a juicy bone, digging yourselves 
                    further and further into trouble. </br></br>
                    On the other hand, however, you hate superficiality or deceit 
                    in others. This, combined with your own underlying emotional 
                    insecurity, means you guard your feelings closely and are wary 
                    of new people. You prefer to stick to your pack and those who 
                    have earned your trust. </br></br>
                    Dogs are sticklers for issues and are swift to judge those 
                    they see as unethical. You will fiercely protect your 
                    values and stand your ground against anyone who attacks your beliefs. </br></br>
                    Dogs are most compatible with Tigers or Horses.

                <h1>Pig</h1>
                <p>
                    The Chinese Pig is the most honorable animal of the zodiac. 
                    Gentle and home-loving, Pigs are generous and indulgent by nature. </br></br>
                    Unlike the typical view of the Pig, the Chinese Pig is known for 
                    its impeccable manners, exquisite taste and gentle disposition. </br></br>
                    You Pigs love comfort and prefer to indulge in a luxurious home 
                    than in going out. Subsequently, you spend more time with close 
                    friends and family than in wider social circles. </br></br>
                    You hate emotional uncertainty but Pigs are incapable of making 
                    hard decisions so you often end up putting up with relationships 
                    that don’t entirely satisfy you. You would still rather be with 
                    an unsuitable partner than be alone as one of your greatest fears is isolation. </br></br>
                    The most compatible match for a Pig is a Rabbit or a Goat.
